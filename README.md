# Module-2-Challenge (Assignment)

## Overview of Project: Stock Analysis Efficient Coding
### Detail: 
A stock analysis was perform during module studies, it was giving required results but timing of year-over-year analysis outputs were not smart enough. Coding was aslo not very professionally done. VBA codes needed to be refactored for efficiency and to performance measures. 

### Result: 
Revised coding by using arrays, loops and structured methon successfully reduced run time of analysis dashboard for stocks performances by year. 

## Summary: 
### 1- Advantages and Disadvantages of code refactoring:
*	Itâ€™s easier to understand, execute and update codes by restructuring long complexed VBA (or any) programming codes.
*	Repetitive tasks can be performed through function, procedure or sub-program rather repeating same codes each time.
*	If followed programing language specific SOPs and techniques, code refactoring will provide enhanced security and long term reliability. 
==================================================================================================================================
*	Required advanced level of programing skills and additional coding, testing  and documentations time and resources
*	May not be able to catch exceptions in production/customized environment and introduce new bugs and fixes.
*	Required hands-on training for new users or beginners. 

### 2- Original vs Refactored VBA Codes:  
* Original code was very long and execution time-consuming since it was reading Excel data file line by line and then captured total volumes and stocks rates of returns for each ticker (stocks) separately. Refactored codes was easy to understand, structured and showed execution effeciency. 
* In terms of processing time: original codes execution time was about 25 to 29 ms (millisecond) and refactored codes took  5 to 8 ms  (Tested on Windows 10, Intel 3.0 GHz i5 processor)
